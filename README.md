Implement application for reading readme.md 
files from every user's (for example spotify) public
github repository and count 3 most popular words 
that are longer than 4 letter. You can use any 

framework or trick that you like to make your code
 shorter and faster, Java is the one limitation. 
Application can be CLI or simple web service, 
wrapping it to the docker container would be a nice bonus.
